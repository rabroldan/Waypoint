ney as it marks my f12323123131231312234234rst venture into creating a command-line tool (CL tool) from scratch. Originally designed to convert plain text files into HTML for easy accessibility, it has since evolved to include the conversion of Markdown files. The project provided a unique learning opportunity, allowing me to delve into the intricacies of Python and CL tool development. I gained valuable insights into handling command-line arguments, file processing, and HTML generation. As I continue to refine Waypoint and explore new features, I am excited about its potential to simplify the journaling process for myself and others, offering a streamlined and distraction-free environment for content creation. This project has not only expanded my technical skills but also ignited a passion for creating practical solutions through coding.
